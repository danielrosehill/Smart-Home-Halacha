Okay, today is the 3rd of December 2025, the 14th day of Kislev, and I say the Hebrew date because
I have my delightful, of all the little sulfur projects I've viped coated over the course at 2025,
which there have been many. I actually feel the most proud about my Hebrew date widget for KDE plasma
on Ubuntu. I was actually really surprised to see that no one had made one before. I was looking
at the widgets, and I saw there was an Islamic calendar, there was an Apali calendar, which I didn't
even know existed, and I was like, surely there's one for the Hebrew calendar, and to my surprise,
there wasn't. So I said, aha, plot the man who can do everything, or the boss who can do everything.
Let's try make a KDE plasma widget, and it worked. I love it. It's brilliant. It's using the
Heepkal API for the Hebrew date, and it requires your location to get course geolocation,
and you can put your precise geolocation, but generally the city is sufficient for the purpose
of his man name, Jewish calendar dates, because unless it's a very big urban area, it doesn't tend.
Well, 32nd difference, maybe. Anyway, that's for the user to decide which level of
precision that they are happy with. What I created this repository today for was to just gather
together some notes for Jewish observance and smart home. I've already created and shared a few
templates for home automation on GitHub and on blogs. One of them was there is a couple of Jewish
integrations for home assistant. One provides the, I think it's called Shabbat, and holidays Jewish
integration, and that provides his man name, and a binary sensor for Yom Tov and one for, sorry,
yeah, one for Haag and one for Shabbat. My little innovation, I think, was the first thing I
created successfully in home assistant was a downstream sensor, because for my automations,
and I think for a lot of folks, it's an either or as in, I have a program that occurs whether it
is Shabbat or a Yom Tov and not either or. So it's just a little, you can also automate that by
having two trigger conditions, which by home assistant are automatically interpreted as either or,
if I recall, but it just allowed me to create a single sensor and use that for lights and whatnot.
So that's what I'm sure before, and what I wanted to create this one for was just jotting down some
notes from myself, which are not from a, I'm not needless to say, a rabbi, anything close to a rabbi,
but I am very interested in this area, and I believe there's a huge amount that smart home
technology has to offer for the religiously observant population. It can do so much, take the
place of those kind of clunky old manual switches, and even those home assistant is a bit of work
to set up. If you look at like the Zmanim sensor, for example, works, the Shabbat times work so
well, and even with, if you buy like a two-year light of the shelf and you have, there is a timer,
but you're not going to update that timer on every device you own every single week manually to
align with Shabbat times. So, home assistant really takes that flexibility, just brings it,
brings it into the system. So it's really terrific, and we've been using it at home for,
we've had a Shabbat automation, based on the Hebrew calendar sensor and based on actually my
upstream sensor from that, and it pretty reliably works when I've kind of done a few
permutations like before Shabbat, 30 minutes before Shabbat, there's an announcement on the speaker,
lighting sets, midnight, there's a bedtime automation, 9 in the morning, to give us a bit of a lie,
and there's a morning automation, even afternoon automation, and these automations are just
turning on and off lights and ACs, so like the midnight one turns off the air conditioner in the living room,
morning one turns it back on, etc, etc, and it just works, and that really is the kind of
goal is really a set it and forget it system, which is what the Shabbat time sensor allows,
because you don't have to do anything, you don't never need to update Shabbat times,
they're coming from the integration, and the automations are baked around at Shabbat time,
so it really, really does work very well. So what I wanted to do in this repository specifically,
why I'm recording these notes is just to talk about a couple of hallochic issues that I want to
look into, and again, emphasizing that this I'm not doing so, as like this is what I figured out,
it's more, these are just kind of my open source notes on the topic. The reason I actually set it
up today was a specific, I've just set up a few human presence sensors in the house,
these are for anyone who's not familiar with this exact type of sensor, it's a little miniature radar
essentially, which makes it sound way more sophisticated than it is, and detects movement, and based
on that it's a binary sensor, true false, for whether movement is being detected, and there's a
sensitivity threshold to it, and kind of a cool off time, so it doesn't over trigger, under trigger.
I wanted to get one of these because I keep leaving lights off, lights on in the living room,
so I set up an automation, it actually worked beautifully, fantastically, between midnight and ADM,
the automation runs, and it says if there's no motion, turn off the lights, so if I'm not in the room,
there's no motion, the lights go off, and that already saves us, sorts out the kind of
Daniel left on the living room lights issue, and turns off the electricity, and cuts down on our
electricity wastage, which cuts down on our power bill, and on our unnecessary use of power,
terms environment, and then on the flip side there's a reverse condition, which is between
midnight and ADM, if motion is detected, it means Daniel is farging, is on a midnight snack hunt,
and we're going to turn on just a very low light, so that he won't be woken up during his act of
scavenging the fridge for food, and then when I go back to bed after having scavenged,
the off light, the off condition will still be in effect, and it'll turn the lights off,
and this is, I feel like, you know, oh my gosh, it works so well, so the challenge here is on
Shabbat, these sensors, that they're sensing motion, and then by you, by any human who moves,
you're triggering the sensors, so my presumption would be that that is not, that is a problem on Shabbat,
and my notes are not so much to explore that, whether that's a problem as to think about some ways
that in Home Assistant, it probably will come down to just me providing a code sample,
for a way to have the automation running every day, actually I've already, it's already come to mind,
I could just add an auth condition to the automations, but that actually is a lucky question,
here's my lucky question, so I can sort out that, I can sort out the automation, the light's turning
on and off by the following, the automation that turns the lights off and on, I can add a
condition that says Shabbat is false, that means if Shabbat is true, the automation won't take
effect, so the user me will come into the room at 1am on Saturday morning, and no actions will be
taken by the automation because the condition Shabbat is true was not met, therefore the automation
does not continue, that's how an automation works, and I'm kind of trying to just explain the
technical stuff, because I'm thinking about a specific friend, I'd like to send this to
who is Arabi, and might have some thoughts, because this is I think a really interesting area of
how I can apply to modern technologies, so I have a fix, I have a pretty easy fix at the
technical level for the lights turning on issue, but what I don't have a fix for is the following,
even if the light doesn't turn on, nevertheless the sensor, the human present sensor is internally
registering motion, it's going from false to true, the only way to disable that is to take the
batteries out, and needless to say it's not practical that before Shabbat, one is going to go
around the house, pulling out batteries from every, you might have five, I think I ordered four of them,
and then putting the back in after Shabbat, so that's not a viable solution, so my question really
is notes to self, I might find that someone has engineered a very specific sensor for the needs
of the Jewish religious population, even a present sensor, and it happens to integrate with
home assistant and Zigbee, but I think pigs will be flying over Jerusalem before such a product
exists, I very much doubt it does, so hopefully I don't, I don't wish the conclusion that all my
sensors are problematic, that sensor type one, sensor type two, you could almost say this is a
luxury sensor, I don't really need the human present sensor, it's just something I bought because I
said, well you know this is what happens is people like me go from functioning members of
society, well adjusted members of society who go out to meet their friends and bars to
hermits, automating their home is you get sucked in, sensor by sensor to home assistant,
so it's not a, it's not something I need, I just thought well I have this system, that's why
don't I add that, it's where it was actually really for, for our newborn, sorry, a tangent,
a newborn, just when we're bringing him into change him in the middle of the night, I thought
sometimes I don't, I can't hit the light sensor, and I thought let's put it, anyway, that's why I
really, really put it on, sensor two for a lactic discussion and debate and consideration is a
security sensor, now my wife and I are renters, and we trust that those listening will not
abuse the open sourcing of this information to attempt to rob us, I'm joking, this is my
drill sensor humor combined with me being very groggy when I recorded this at an early hour
the morning and being, I'm waking up as I speak into this microphone,
we rent and we, as renters we don't have like a proper alarm system, but what I did is set up a
Zigbee-based system, now this is actually, this is a real, this is a more serious,
a lucky question because I don't would never want to be without any kind of alarm system at home,
and if I can't put one in as a renter, I'm going to figure out a way to get some kind of alarming
through my own needs, for people who take the DIY approach to alarming, so professionally installed
alarm systems, if I recall correctly and from the very authoritative source of information on
this, like oceans 11, the movie, frequently are laser-based, so you'll have a laser pointing
across a potential entry surface, and if something, if you move, you're going to interrupt the laser
beam and that's going to trigger the alarm, now unfortunately for those of us who are hacking our
way to some kind of home alarm system, I haven't seen any DIY laser-based system that works for
a home assistant, probably is, as I say that, but what there is is a more primitive device, which is a
door window sensor, a door window sensor, which I have about 10 at home,
operates by the following mechanism, you have a magnet, you've got two little vertical devices,
about the size of, about four or five centimeters, each, just a little, envision them as a coin,
like a 50 cent coin, or a five-shackle coin if you're listening in Israel, and when a door opens,
the two pull apart, because one is fixed to the outer surface of the door, the door frame,
one is fixed to the door, or the window, and that is the trigger condition,
so when the magnets are together, it's false, when the magnets are not together,
physically, when the magnetism is lost, that turns to a true condition, which means in human terms,
the door is open, you don't know by how much, by what extent the door is open, you don't know,
you don't have a video feed of the door, you just know that this is how these sensors work,
they're low power, they can run on battery for a year, they're brilliant, but they keep their
information very light, so it's a true condition or a false condition, binary sensor,
so we have these, now the problem is, for, this is how they work for alarming, you can say,
overnight, if any of the door sensors turn to true, probably means our house has been broken into,
trigger the alarm, simplified example, now the issue is, that again, on Shabbat, let's say I
disable the a sensor for Shabbat evening, because I don't want to have guests who leave the house
when I am in the morning, and they're going to trigger the alarm, okay, I can do that, I can edit
my sensors for Shabbat, or I can, or I can have, I can not have the alarm system armed,
the problem is just as with the human present sensors, even though the system is not armed,
those sensors are still, every time the door opens, momentarily, a little light comes on, it says,
true, and it goes off, so inadvertently you or your Shabbat keeping guests would be triggering the
condition, and again, just like in the previous case, it's really not feasible to pull out all the
batteries, and I don't know if there's any other solution, but it's actually really the same,
I think, calachic complication as with the human present sensors, in the sense that these are both
really, really helpful during the week, and it seems to me like a terrible pity not to be able to
certainly secure your home, if that's the only way that you are able to, and maybe that brings
in a certain consideration, and a human presence, so that's it from my first installation,
and I know there's a couple of organizations and institutions that are actually really involved
in this space, some institution whose name I forget, but I'll leave it there for the moment,
just for the, I'll just put this in the repository, and come back to exploring it at a later point in time.
