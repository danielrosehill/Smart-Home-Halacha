# Smart Home + Halacha

This repository is a small collection of notes that I may update over time regarding questions of halacha that may arise in respect to smart home operation. 

Smart home technologies - like Home Assistant - offer enormous benefits and flexibility to religiously observant Jewish users. 

To that end, from time to time, I have shared a few notes and scripts - such as [this template](https://github.com/danielrosehill/Home-Assistant-YomTov-Shabbat-0125) which offers a downstream combined Shabbat and Yom Tov sensor so that automations can be triggered when *either* condition is true.

Home Assistant can be used to:

- Replace manual timers with smart ones that can be calibrated automatically to Shabbat times (thanks to the work of projects like HebCal and integrations like Jewish Calendar!) 
- Provide visual indications for the start and end of Shabbat and *hagim* (when Shabbat is over, turn this light off, etc)  

It's even helpful from an environmental and cost-saving standpoint.

Before HA:

- Leave air conditioning running for the whole of Shabbat/Chag

After HA:

- Set up a recurring Shabbat/Chag automation. Scenes and automations turn lighting and ACs on and off befitting a recurrent pattern. 

## Notes Here 

I started this repository to gather together a few questions about one specific topic but am keeping it as a placeholder for future questions that may arise. 

To state the obvious:

I am not a Rabbi! These are merely my own personal notes and may not be reflective of the halacha you hold by.
