# Halachic Considerations for Smart Home Technology

*Personal notes - not halachic rulings. Consult your posek.*

## General Principles

Smart home automation on Shabbat generally relies on the principle that pre-programmed automations that run without direct human intervention may be permissible, similar to traditional Shabbat timers (shaaon Shabbat).

### Key Distinctions

1. **Pre-programmed vs. triggered actions**: Automations that run at fixed times (like a timer) differ from those triggered by human action (like motion sensors)

2. **Direct vs. indirect causation**: Whether the person's action directly causes the result or merely sets conditions for an automated response

3. **Intentional vs. unintentional**: Whether triggering a sensor is the person's intent or an unavoidable byproduct of normal activity

## Sensor Categories

### Category A: Time-Based Automations

Automations triggered purely by time (e.g., "at sunset, turn on lights") are generally analogous to traditional Shabbat timers and are widely accepted.

### Category B: Condition-Based Automations

Automations that check conditions but are not directly triggered by human action (e.g., "if temperature > 25C and time is between 2pm-4pm, turn on AC") occupy a middle ground.

### Category C: Human-Triggered Sensors

Sensors that respond to human presence or action raise more complex questions:

- Motion/presence sensors
- Door/window contact sensors
- Pressure sensors
- Break-beam sensors

## The Core Question

Even when automations are disabled for Shabbat, many sensors continue to:
- Register state changes internally
- Transmit data (often via Zigbee/Z-Wave)
- Display indicator lights
- Log events

**Is the internal registration of a state change itself problematic, even when no visible action results?**

## Areas for Research

- Grama (indirect causation) in electronic contexts
- Pesik reisha (inevitable consequences) with modern sensors
- Davar she'eino mitkaven (unintended action) applications
- Whether electronic state changes constitute "melacha"
- Security considerations (pikuach nefesh) for alarm sensors
